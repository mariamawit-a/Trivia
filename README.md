## General info
The game has three modes: Chill mode(learning mode), Part of One(practice mode), and Join the Party(fun & challenging mode).

Current events have made it evident that although we are living in the information age, we do not appear to be well informed.

    "As a society, we are now spending too much time, energy, and capital battling wilful ignoranceâ€”about 
    climate control, about the genuine effects of social policies, about the extent and impact of 
    governmental programs, about immigrants,about those who are different."
   <em>[- We live in a culture of ignorance](https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5245/we-live-in-a-culture-of-ignorance)</em>
    
There has never been a better time to be a scholar; never better resources for an informed citizenry. It is the information we absorb that builds our belief which in turn is the basis of our ethics. With OTrivia we hope to foster a fun learning environment. We want everybody to keep learning, keep questioning and stay curious, while having fun!

## Code Examples

**Using local storage to store objects**
```js
Storage.prototype.setObj = function(key, obj) {
    return this.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(obj))
  }
Storage.prototype.getObj = function(key) {
  return JSON.parse(this.getItem(key))
}
```

**Mixing the choices**
```js
    $(function () {

                    var parents = $("#choices");
                    var divs = parents.children();

                    while(divs.length){
                    parents.append(divs.splice(Math.floor(Math.random() * divs.length), 1)[0]);
                    }

                    const name = `choicefor${num}`;
                    document.getElementById('choices').setAttribute('id', `chosen${num}`);
               
                    ++num;
                }); 
```
