## General info
The game has three modes: Chill mode(learning mode), Part of One(practice mode), and Join the Party(fun & challenging mode).

Current events have made it evident that although we are living in the information age, we do not appear to be well informed.

    "As a society, we are now spending too much time, energy, and capital battling wilful ignorance—about climate control,
    about the genuine effects of social policies, about the extent and impact of governmental programs, about immigrants,
    about those who are different. Many public figures, many voters, wear their ignorance like a badge of honour.
    When challenged and cornered, they retreat to the hollow claim that “I have a right to believe whatever I want.”
   <em>[- We live in a culture of ignorance](https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5245/we-live-in-a-culture-of-ignorance)</em>
    
There has never been a better time to be a scholar; never better resources for an informed citizenry. As it is the information we absorb that builds our belief which is the base of our ethics. With OTrivia we hope to foster a fun learning environment. We want everybody to keep learning, question and stay curious while having fun!

OTrivia is a trivia website 
A Trivia game that allows the user to select topics and trends with a retro 90s look to it! Players have a choice between three modes: a speed mode, a single player mode, and multiplayer mode. While playing either each mode, players can use a certain number of pre-selected avatars or use their own snap bitmoji as a avatar along with a username of their choice. And to keep track of progress the players can use the scoreboard to hold on to their progress in the game.
