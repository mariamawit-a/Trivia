# Welcome To OTrivia

## Description

A Trivia game that allows the user to select topics and trends with a retro 90s look to it! Players have a choice between three modes: a speed mode, a single player mode, and multiplayer mode. While playing either each mode, players can use a certain number of pre-selected avatars or use their own snap bitmoji as a avatar along with a username of their choice.
